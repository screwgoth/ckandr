About
-----
ckandr is a python-based command-line application Cryptocurrency prices from popular Indian cryptocurrency exchanges.
There are already some great command-line cryptocurrency price ticker tools like `Coinmon`_ and it's python port `Pycoinmon`_.
ckandr is heavily inspired by both these projects.
However, both these projects get their data from `CoinMarketCap`_'s API. This is of no use to Indian investors who are investing through Indian exchanges like `Koinex`_, `ZebPay`_ and others.
ckandr aims to solve this problem by fetching prices from these sites (and more to follow soon).

For all you non-Hindi speaking people out there, ckandr is a play on a Hindi word, Sikander, which means a "warrior" or "defender". And the pseudo-acronym of ckandr, Crypto KA Naya Desi Rate, just means the latest price of cryptocurrencies in Rupees(INR).
